Reading data from file:
1. Read raw bytes:
    buf := make([]byte, 16)
    f.read(buf)

2. Buffered Reading:
    reader := bufio.NewReader(f)
    reader.Read() : raw bytes
    reader.ReadString()

3. Higher level text interface:
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(f)
    scanner.Scan(): scanner.Text()
    strings.Fields(text)

Encoder appends to the file as long as file is opened in append mode or file pointer is at end
It does not truncate or overwrite the file, it simply writes JSON bytes starting at current file offset
It internally does file.Write() at current offset

Mixing file.Seek() and bufio.Writer on the same file can cause offset issues since
bufio.Writer keeps its own internal buffer, it does know you called Seek()
Once you wrap a file in bufio.NewWriter(), must not call f.Seek and must not perform unbuffered writes to that same file
So don't buffer when you seek
